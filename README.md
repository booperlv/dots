dotfiles :)

Here's a peek!

Terminal command mode, and the usual Power Menu using sxlock.

As you may see from a little peek into the configs, these dotfiles are NOT made for general use. You will have to edit a number of paths and place these files in their corresponding places. I could've fixed a few things (such as ~ instead of /home/booperlv in python) but let's just say I'm too lazy for it :D.

These are fairly easy to configure though.
I have a cool motd in there too! I use it for my emptty configuration. Couple of versions there.

All the Wallpapers I have in local/share/pictures are modified versions from [LAM's](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/17429) art.
