# dots
I'm on a low resolution 11.6 inch screen, so things might look different.

# Take Note!
These dotfiles are ever changing as I am still keep finding more ways to make my experience better :D

If you ever wonder why this repository is big, I store a two copies of all the gtk theme assets here for color generation so :D

I am using colemak, so my bindings are rather unusual.

As you may see from a little peek into the configs, these dotfiles are NOT made for general use. You will have to edit a number of paths and place these files in their corresponding places.

Maybe you can steal a few things here and there instead.

The Wallpapers I have in local/share/pictures named feh(index) are modified versions from [LAM's](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/17429) art.
Others are either taken from reddit or somewhere on the internet.

## What is emptywindow.c?
It is literally just an empty window that's transparent if you have a compositor. Like a placeholder in a tiling wm.
Compile with "gcc -lX11 emptywindow.c -o emptywindow". You can copy the binary file to any directory in your path to execute.

## What is updatenvimnightlybuild.sh?
A small bash script I created for adding the appimage into my path. Pretty sure it's not a great idea to use it though LOL.
Neovim 5.0 is being pushed to stable soon anyway! :)


Self note: using Papirus and Vimix Black Icon themes, Breeze and Vimix Cursor Themes
