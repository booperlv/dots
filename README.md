# dots

I literally just use this as a google drive of sorts, take the bits you want but
I'm too lazy to make it something you can just copy and it'd just work :P

The scripts here (especially in .config/sway/scripts) don't all work as is,
because I keep the gtk theme assets and other files in a different repository (as it would make this repo unneccesarily bloated)

The more interesting and "usable" bits outside of my system are the configs in .config/waybar .config/nvim.
Everything else is not of much use, to be honest.

The Wallpapers I have in local/share/pictures with LAM on the name are modified
versions from [LAM's](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/17429) art.

Others are either taken from reddit or somewhere on the internet. A reverse
image search would do wonders, I don't really keep the sources - sorry.
