Sway & Qtile :)
Mainly use sway though, so qtile may be rough around the edges, especially when it comes to the scripts.
I'm on a low resolution 11.6 inch screen btw, so things might look different.

# Sway
Here's a peek!

# Qtile
Don't really use this much anymore since sway is so good, but keep it here just in case. Barely maintain the scripts here.

# Extras
Generated gtk theme on Thunar, and Rofi :)

As you may see from a little peek into the configs, these dotfiles are NOT made for general use. You will have to edit a number of paths and place these files in their corresponding places.

These are fairly easy to configure though.
I have a cool motd in there too! I use it for my emptty configuration.

The Wallpapers I have in local/share/pictures named feh(index) are modified versions from [LAM's](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/17429) art.
Others are either stolen from reddit or the internet.

A note about emptywindow.c:
It is literally just an emptywindow that's transparent if you have a compositor. Like a placeholder in a tiling wm.
Compile with "gcc -lX11 emptywindow.c -o emptywindow". You can copy the binary file to /usr/local/bin to execute.

Self note: using Papirus and Vimix Black Icon themes, Breeze and Vimix Cursor Themes
