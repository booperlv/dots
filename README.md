# dots
I'm on a low resolution 11.6 inch screen, so things might look different.

# Take Note!
These dotfiles are ever changing as I am still keep finding more ways to make my experience better :D

I am using colemak, so my bindings are rather unusual.

# Sway
Here's a peek!

# Qtile
Don't really use this much anymore since sway is so good, but keep it here just in case. I don't touch the scripts there much anymore.

As you may see from a little peek into the configs, these dotfiles are NOT made for general use. You will have to edit a number of paths and place these files in their corresponding places.

Maybe you can steal a few things here and there :)

The Wallpapers I have in local/share/pictures named feh(index) are modified versions from [LAM's](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/17429) art.
Others are either taken from reddit or somewhere on the internet.

A note about emptywindow.c:
It is literally just an empty window that's transparent if you have a compositor. Like a placeholder in a tiling wm.
Compile with "gcc -lX11 emptywindow.c -o emptywindow". You can copy the binary file to any directory in your path to execute.

Self note: using Papirus and Vimix Black Icon themes, Breeze and Vimix Cursor Themes
